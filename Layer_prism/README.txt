Code is written for 2 different model.For model 1 when density is constant for all prisms only depth is varying set output node no at the no of depth data points. For running for model 1 comment out model 2 commands .To run Layer_test  PrismDM, Layer and sigmoid function is required. Then run Layer_train without clearing the workspace.PrismDM calculate the anomaly for a single prism while Layer calculate the total anomaly due to stacked prism layer.
